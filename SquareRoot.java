/*
 * Letâ€™s say you are given a number, a, and you want to find its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the answer, x0, and then improve the guess using this formula:
  x1 = (x0 + a/x0)/2. 
  Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an ap- proximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use Math.sqrt.
